        Where is the key? Where is the key to the door? The door stays locked.
        It doesn't open. You've tried and tried but it won't budge. You know the
        key's waiting to be found, somewhere. Don't stop searching. Day by day
        you'll get closer. Close enough to realize the key is in your hand.
      </p>

        Consistency is key. Our continous efforts unlock the door. There's no
        need to be trapped any longer. What helps you stay consistent? What
        keeps you going? To figure that out it's simple. Keep moving. Take a
        step. Learn. Work hard, rest hard. Have faith. Find what works for YOU.
        What works for YOU isn't what necessarily works for someone else. An
        optimal routine can become suboptimal when you're not showing up. What
        will keep you here trying?
      </p>

      <p>
        We're here to help YOU figure that out. The fundamental principle here
        at The Key is consistency. We're going to work with YOU to create the
        diet and exercise routine that you can stick to. The door won't stay
        closed for much longer. YOU just got to stay consistent.
